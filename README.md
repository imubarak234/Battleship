# Battleship

A simple variation of the battleship game with new rules, fight types and ships. For now only a one player version is available with multiple difficulty levels.

## Game Play

In this variation of Battleship I use two forms of interface the command-line and the graphical user interface for gameplay with there are three different types of ships. 

- Wing  

- Starship  

- Warbird 

With different weapons in their arsenals strikers, laser cannons, photon torpedoes, cloaking tech. On like the two sided 2D grid in Simon Fernandes (2012) version my ships battle in arenas called fights. The fights are of different types skirmish, ambush, battle each fight has a set of ships that can partake in that fight. Each fight also has an enemy strength to become to win the fight. There is a reward system or money called talents. The user starts the game with a certain amount of talents and if you win a fight you get a reward increase in talents if loss you get a deduction. There are four different states your forces (ships) docked, active, resting, decommissioned. If a ship is resting it has undertaken and won a fight but cannot be used again only if recalled back to the Admiral fleet which will cost talents. The decommissioned ships have been suck and are out of the game. The docked ships are in your Allied fleet and need to be activated into your Admiral fleet before they can be used for a fight. The active state means the ship is active, in your Admiral fleet and ready to fight. There are two fleets in the game the Allied Fleet and the Admiral fleet. The first contains all possible ships the second contains all usable ships.  

The game starts with a number of fights depending on the difficulty level between Hard, Medium or Easy respectively. A number of forces(ships) are in your Allied fleet. The objective is to use your talents wisely to activate relevant forces to partake in the given fights. Use the ships given to overcome the fights and once all fights are cleared the game is won and vice-versa once all the talents are over and all ships are decommissioned the game is lost.
